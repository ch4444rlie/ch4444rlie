# Hi, I'm Charles! üëã

I'm a data enthusiast with a background in **Integrative Biology** (University of Illinois, 3.83 GPA) and a passion for **Python**, **data analysis**, and **synthetic data generation**. My projects focus on creating realistic datasets, building graph databases, and applying machine learning to solve real-world problems. I enjoy simplifying complex technical concepts for non-experts and building tools that are both practical and educational.

## üöÄ What I Do
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Crafting realistic datasets like bank statements, crime reports, and orders for privacy-safe development and learning.
- **Graph Databases**: Designing and visualizing interconnected data using K√πzu and yFiles, from webpage link networks to employee organizational structures and more.
- **Machine Learning**: Developing neural networks to predict article relevance, analyze meme coin prices, or other things that interest me.

## üìö Featured Projects
- **[Synthetic Bank Statement Generator](https://github.com/ch4444rlie/SyntheticBank)**  
  Generates realistic bank statements as PDFs using Python, Jinja2, and wkhtmltopdf. Designed for educational purposes to practice data handling while prioritizing privacy.
  For a lightweight demo: [**Synthetic Bank Statement Demo**](https://synthetic-newoooooaooooaoooa.streamlit.app/)  
  *Technologies*: Python, HTML, LLMs (Grok, ChatGPT), pdfkit.

- **[Synthetic Crime Report Data](https://github.com/ch4444rlie/SyntheticCrimeReport)**  
  Creates synthetic crime reports with NIEM-inspired XML tagging to practice data structuring and government standards. Includes visualizations using NetworkX and Matplotlib.  
  *Technologies*: Python, XML, NetworkX, Matplotlib, Ollama.

- **[Webpages Graph Database](https://github.com/ch4444rlie/WebpagesGraphDatabase)**  
  A K√πzu graph database of webpages and links, visualized with yFiles. Extracts and categorizes content using BeautifulSoup and pandas for network analysis.  
  *Technologies*: Python, K√πzu, yFiles, BeautifulSoup, pandas.

## üî• Active Project List
- **[Anti-Money Laundering Neural Network](https://github.com/ch4444rlie/MoneyLaundering)**  
  A neural network that aims to predict suspicious money laundhering activity in a synthetic dataset
  *Technologies so far*: Python, Kuzu, Torch, Matplotlib, NumPy, Scikit, (Methods inspired by [Project Aurora](https://github.com/ch4444rlie/MoneyLaundering/blob/master/aml-pa.pdf)).
