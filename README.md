# Hi, I'm Charles! üëã

I enjoy playing with data, machine learning techniques, and AI. My background is in **Integrative Biology** (University of Illinois, 3.83 GPA). The projects here focus on building graph databases, creating realistic datasets, and applying machine learning to solve real-world problems. 

## üìö Featured Projects
- **[Webpages Graph Database](https://github.com/ch4444rlie/WebpagesGraphDatabase)**  
  A Dockerized app harnessing K√πzu graph databasing to organize webpages and links, visualized with yFiles. Extracts and categorizes content using BeautifulSoup and pandas for network analysis, with Ollama generating keywords and summaries for links.
<br>*Technologies*: Docker, Python, K√πzu, yFiles, BeautifulSoup, pandas, Ollama.

- **[Fantasy Anti-Money Laundering Lab](https://github.com/ch4444rlie/Fantasy_synthetic_lab)**  
  A notebook lab that highlights technology used in real world anti-money laundering practices, wrapped in the context of a fantasy themed detective story.
  *Technologies*: Python, SDV, Ollama, ReportLab, Torch, ChromaDB.
  
- **[Synthetic Bank Statement Generator](https://github.com/ch4444rlie/SyntheticBank)**  
  Generates realistic bank statements as PDFs using Python, Jinja2, and wkhtmltopdf. Designed for educational purposes to practice data handling while prioritizing privacy.
  For a lightweight demo: [**Synthetic Bank Statement Demo**](https://synthetic-newoooooaooooaoooa.streamlit.app/)  
  *Technologies*: Python, HTML, LLMs (Grok, ChatGPT), pdfkit.
